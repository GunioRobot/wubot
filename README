This project is the 9th generation of a personal reactive automation
tool I've been working on for the last several years.

The simplest way to think of this project is that it is like email
rules on steroids.  Most email clients allow you to set rules to tell
the email client what to do when a new email arrives.  This project
allows you to have a set of monitors that collect data from email
boxes, rss feeds, IRC, XMPP, log files, system monitors, xmltv, tivo,
etc., or you can even write your own custom monitor plugins in perl.
Data collected from each monitor is sent through a set of rules that
can perform actions such as:

  - pop up an alert, e.g. using Growl
  - send a colorized message to stdout
  - store the message in a mailbox
  - add the message to a SQLite database
  - store data from the message in RRD and graph the data over time
  - add the message to outgoing RSS feeds
  - send a notification to IRC

Beyond just doing something with the message or portions of the
message, you also have the option to modify the message, e.g. set a
color to be used for alerts, transform some field in the message with
a regexp, capture data from a field, strip HTML, and so forth.

The monitors can run locally on any number of hosts, and can be
processed locally, and/or forwarded to another host for further
processing.

Unlike previous generations of this project, the rules are entirely
controlled by configuration.  So it is not necessary to write any perl
code to use the rules.  In the future there will be a user interface
for configuring the rules.

Rules can be nested, so that when a rule matches, it can cause
additional sub-rules to run.  Nesting rules makes the rules processing
much more efficient so that not every rule needs to be run on every
message.  Rules processing is recursive and rules can be nested
arbitrarily deep.

This project is still under construction.

More to come...
