This project is still in the alpha stage of development!  Data
handling is reliable, but the user interface is still rough.

INSTALLATION

To install wubot, use the standard CPAN installation methods:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

Or simply:

  cpan Wubot

Note that you will probably have to create a ~/wubot and ~/logs
directory.  In the future these directories should be configurable.

Also will also need to create ~/wubot/schemas, and copy the files from
the 'config/schemas' directory into that directory.

To get the web interface up and going, see here:
