Wubot::Guide::Debugging - guide for debugging feeds

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The following document attempts to describe some steps you can take to
create a new reaction or debug a reaction that isn't working properly.


=head2 wubot-check

The wubot-check script lives in the bin directory.  It can be used to
run a single check of an instance of a monitor.  Simply pass in
the name of the plugin and the name of the instance config file, e.g.:

  wubot-check RSS usgs-m5

This would attempt to read a file:

  ~/wubot/config/plugins/RSS/usgs-m5.yaml

It will actually search for any file in the RSS directory that begins
with usgs-m5.yaml, so even if you have disabled the plugin instance by
renaming the .yaml file to .yaml.disabled, it will still be loaded.

The check instance's cache file will be read and the check will be
executed once, and any reactor messages generated will be dumped to
stdout.  So if you have previously run this instance of the monitor,
it's cache data may prevent it from re-sending any messages.  See the
'cache file' section below.

Any reactions defined directly in the monitor config will be executed,
so this can be a great way to debug simple reactions like setting or
modifying fields on the message.


=head2 cache file

Many monitor plugins cache data that has been seen in a cache file.
The cache files live here:

  ~/wubot/cache/{key}.yaml

For example, the cache file for RSS-usgs-m5 would live here:

  ~/wubot/cache/RSS-usgs-m5.yaml

Once this cache file has been created, if you run the monitor again,
it may send through no data.  To re-send feed data through for
debugging, it may help to remove or temporarily rename the cache file.

If deleting the cache file sends too much data to see what is
happening, then you could edit the cache file, remove a single entry,
and then re-run the wubot-check script to trigger that item to get
re-processed.


=head2 Dumper reactor plugin

When the trouble is occurring in the reactor config, sometimes seeing
the raw monitor data using wubot-check isn't so helpful.  In such
cases you can use the Dumper reactor plugin to dump out the entire
message contents.  At the point of confusion, simply insert a rule
like this:

  - name: dump message contents
    plugin: Dumper

Note that where you put the rule may make all the difference.  For
example, if you have a rule that modifies the message, then using the
Dumper rule before that rule would show you the contents before the
message was modified, and using the Dumper rule after the message
modifying rule would show you the modified content.


=head2 Logging

Both wubot-monitor and wubot-reactor write logs to ~/logs.  The logs
are rotated a midnight each night.  Only the last 10 days of logs are
stored.  Both processes default to the 'info' level logging on stdout
and 'debug' level logging to the log files.

To enable debug logging to stdout, export the environment variable
LOG_DEBUG.  For even more debugging info, export LOG_TRACE.  For
example:

  LOG_DEBUG=1 bin/wubot-monitor
  LOG_TRACE=1 bin/wubot-reactor



=head2 wubot queue

Message queues in wubot are implemented using a SQLite database.  The
contents of the message is serialized using YAML::XS and stored in the
SQLite db.

After a message has been processed successfully, the row will not
immediately be deleted.  Instead, wubot will update the row to set the
'seen' column to the time the message was processed.  So you generally
have at least a 24 hour window where you can go back an inspect the
message data that was sent to the reactor in the event of a problem.
You can even re-send the message through the queue by hunting down the
id and setting 'seen' back to null.  This will cause the reactor to
immediately pick the message back up from the queue.  For example:

  # open the default reactor queue
  sqlite3 ~/wubot/reactor/queue.sqlite

  # find the most recent message from the USGS rss feed
  SELECT * FROM message_queue WHERE data LIKE '%RSS-usgs-m5%' ORDER BY lastupdate DESC LIMIT 1;

  # that gets the one we want, so get the id
  SELECT id FROM message_queue WHERE data LIKE '%RSS-usgs-m5%' ORDER BY lastupdate DESC LIMIT 1;

  # now set 'seen' back to null
  UPDATE message_queue SET seen = NULL WHERE id = 21991;

Alternately, if you have a plugin that has sent through a flood of
messages (or you temporarily created a routing loop between bots), the
reactor may take a very long time to crank through all the messages in
the queue.  So you could go in and mark messages as 'seen' or even
delete them if there are a huge number.

  # delete the messages from the queue - be careful here
  update message_queue set seen = 1 where data like '%Some Flooded Message Text%';

  # delete the messages from the queue - be careful here
  delete from message_queue where data like '%Some Flooded Message Text%';

Each time wubot opens a new connection to the database, it will purge
all 'seen' messages that were marked seen more than 24 hours ago.
This ensures the message queue will not get too long, as very long
message queues will significantly degrade performance.  The
performance seems to start to degrade at around 50k messages, and may
use significantly more system resources if the queue grows beyond 100k
messages.  Your mileage may vary.  After purging old seen messages, it
will log the number of seen and unseen messages left in the queue.
