INSTALLATION

To install wubot, use the standard CPAN installation methods:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

Or simply:

  cpan Wubot

Note that you will probably have to create a ~/wubot and ~/logs
directory.  In the future these directories should be configurable.

Also will also need to create ~/wubot/schemas, and copy the files from
the 'config/schemas' directory into that directory.

To get the web interface up and going, see here:
